original doc: We ordered this through the publisher, Scholastic.  Since it was for a six-year old, I was disappointed to find that it wasn't a picture book.  It was a chapter book with one illustration per chapter.    My son, however, wasn't the least put off by the lack of drawings.  For the past few nights, I've read three chapters per night (there are seventeen chapters total).  At the end of the three chapter ration, he's begging me to continue.      (Helpful hint for readers:  Practice your dopey Patrick Starfish voice.  You'll get a lot of laughs over it.)
most simular: When you read "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time", you get a glimpse into the thought processes of an autistic savant. Written in the form of a journal by the teenaged Christopher Boone, this innovative story ostensibly takes us through the boy's efforts to find the killer of his neighbor's dog. But what we really experience is a bittersweet journey of self-discovery for a boy who finds the world a most confusing and illogical place. Haddon, who has worked with autistic children, does a wonderful job of explaining how Christopher perceives his environment and tries to cope with its perplexities. Examples abound of the contrasts between Christopher's literal, logical thought processes and the more typical imaginative and emotional ones. A powerful illustration of intuition versus logic is presented in a deceptively simple "Let's Make a Deal" probability problem that had me struggling for an entire day before accepting and understanding the answer. Don't let the thought of an unemotionally narrated story with math problems in it put you off, however. This book is a delight in every way. We still witness the emotional impact of events on the people around Christopher. Although we feel frustrated over his inability to read others, we cheer him on as he manages to get by in the world in spite of his disability. There are humorous touches throughout the book to prevent it from becoming too maudlin. What more can I say? Read this book!

original doc: The content is accessible and well organized for quick acquisition of knowledge for teaching students, residents and colleagues not to mention for the reader as well. The references are either classic or outdated. A lot of work and time went into the preparation of this book. Are the authors and editors planning to revise and publish a more recent edition?
most simular: Jess Walter is a wonderful writer and takes us on a roller coaster ride of all things Hollywood.  Secrets, loves found and lost (and found again), life styles of the powerful and of those that walk away, addictions, success and failure, and of course plastic surgeries. In the beginning you must read carefully as the author takes us from Italy in 1962, to the present and then an unfinished novel.  There is the inter-working of a Hollywood power player; listening to movie/TV pilot pitches and the memories of a younger man. Your mind is absorbing all the different stories and characters.  Jess Walter is a whiz at developing characters that you can see and feel their emotions, and scenic views that can take your breath away. My one major concern is ALL the different characters and stories, unrolling at the same time.  It can be confusing and a roller coaster ride all at the same time. As the reader you can not assume what information is important to the final stage of the book. For me the ending was the best part of the book as the author ties all the stories and characters together with some surprises. This is a fun, entertaining stories that can be confusing at times.

original doc: I'm very pleased with this little Bible. I like that I can easily carry it with me most anywhere. I wanted a SMALL Bible, and this is perfect. The print is "average" size for what you'd find in an average sized Bible. But for a compact Bible, you can say the print is "large", because it's not teeny-tiny print like in most small Bibles. I do fine with the print size. I think this Bible would make a lovely gift for anyone you'd like to give a Bible too, because it's not huge, and the price is very nice. I love the KJV so that's a plus too. I'm glad I have a small, but very nice size of the WHOLE Bible!
most simular: Meticulously researched and written, The Johnstown Flood is not only a book about the horrific disaster, but a richly crafted piece of social history.  David McCullough delves into the social changes, the newly rich upper class, the immigrants striving to survive and the new middle classes.  It also is a story of early modern engineering's hubris and the unwillingness of men to see their mistakes.  McCullough weaves these themes  and the lives of everyday people into a compelling story of the eventual destruction of Johnstown.  The accounts of the flood are gripping, graphic and heartrending.  I first read this when I was 10 and it was included in a Reader's Digest Condensed Books.  I recently purchased it, after having reread it several times( the last time in preperation for reading a fictionalized account of the people of Johnstown).  This is the definitive Johnstown book.
