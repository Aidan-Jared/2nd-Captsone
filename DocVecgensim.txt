We ordered this through the publisher, Scholastic.  Since it was for a six-year old, I was disappointed to find that it wasn't a picture book.  It was a chapter book with one illustration per chapter.    My son, however, wasn't the least put off by the lack of drawings.  For the past few nights, I've read three chapters per night (there are seventeen chapters total).  At the end of the three chapter ration, he's begging me to continue.      (Helpful hint for readers:  Practice your dopey Patrick Starfish voice.  You'll get a lot of laughs over it.)
GREAT
Excellent story of the DeMeo gang of Brooklyn. Very powerful accounts of the brutality of "that life". Does a very nice job of giving a look into the other side of the Gambino family, the side without John Gotti. The authors do a nice job of taking the romance aspect away from the mafia that is so common in organized crime books, although not always true with Dominick Montiglio. The book also lends itself to understanding the difficulty for law enforcement agencies to prepare and prosecute these powerful families. As close a real life "Godfather" story as you will find.

The content is accessible and well organized for quick acquisition of knowledge for teaching students, residents and colleagues not to mention for the reader as well. The references are either classic or outdated. A lot of work and time went into the preparation of this book. Are the authors and editors planning to revise and publish a more recent edition?

I was very disappointed in this novel. I was expecting something to the effect of The Red Tent (which I thought was great), since it was compared to it on the inside cover. My expectations were too high. I struggled to finish this book. I found myself thinking out loud "what was this writer thinking?"  I totally understand that we all have our interpretations of Bible characters, but there was nothing to remotely associate these characters to history except that you "knew" they were Biblical characters. There is something left to be desired when a reader enjoys the secondary characters more the main ones.  I would not recommend this book.

I'm very pleased with this little Bible. I like that I can easily carry it with me most anywhere. I wanted a SMALL Bible, and this is perfect. The print is "average" size for what you'd find in an average sized Bible. But for a compact Bible, you can say the print is "large", because it's not teeny-tiny print like in most small Bibles. I do fine with the print size. I think this Bible would make a lovely gift for anyone you'd like to give a Bible too, because it's not huge, and the price is very nice. I love the KJV so that's a plus too. I'm glad I have a small, but very nice size of the WHOLE Bible!

This novel was recommended by my cousins wife who is a preacher.  My son had laid a penny on my mothers heart as we laid her to rest.  This story showed me how to look at my mother's life and all the special qualities she had and the obstacles she had to overcome in life.  In return she also taught us to believe in and find the small gifts that are sent our way. Funny how this one penny could find magic in such a great loss. Once again it was the magic penny that reminded me to embrace the gifts that are sent your way even in the face of the greatest losses imaginable. This was made possible by the question asked of me had I read the book The Penny. Small gifts are always there if you accept them and believe.
