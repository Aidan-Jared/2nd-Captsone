original doc: Not only has Brooke McEldowney captured the pure essence of 'cat' but Solange is without a doubt one of the most expressive cartoon cats I have ever seen.  What a wonderful little book.
most simular: In the book Ginger Pye Jerry is just some normal boy who is trying to figure out how to buy a puppy.  Once Jerry has the dog he can't stop thinking about him.  Jerry is really the kind of character who just can't  stand not being around his dog. He loves him so much.  Half of the time  Jerry tries to figure out what has happened to Ginger and can't fid him.   Jerry loves to have a perfect day and that's impossible without his dog.   Jerry is one of those characters who grabs your body and tells you the  story in a very exciting way.All of the best feelings you can think of,  Jerry is almost two of them at once.  I absolutely adored the book Ginger  Pye because the book was very exhilarating, funny, and everything about the  boook was unique.  The book was very enjoyable. I would recommend the book  to anyone who likes a lot of action.  This book can take every single bit  of time of your day until you finish it.  It's just so exciting

original doc: Having worked with Brant for years and having had the pleasure of learning from him on a daily basis, I can say one thing about this book... IT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME LOADS of time had he just written it a few years ago. Seriously, this book is in depth and on point down to all the little tips and tricks we use EVERYDAY. Brant doesn't pull any punches and tells it like it is. If you want fluffy pie in the sky, this IS NOT the book for you. However, if you're serious about real estate and want to learn how to make SERIOUS money flipping houses, then this is the ONLY book you need.
most simular: This book delivers way more than one would expect. Let me explain that. First of all it is not that long of a book.  But for many people it takes a long time to read because the points he makes on every page are so convicting.  Also, it is written by a South African pastor in the 1800's, and has a woodenness to the English that slows you down. This gives the topic a KJV feel to it in some places. Some people don't like that, but I found it enhanced the whole experience of reading this powerful little book. I asked a man in a church about 30 years ago why he was so short and his son was so tall (his son was well over 6'4\" and he was 5'5\"). He said something to me that I never forgot. He said, 'dynamite comes in small packages' so don't ever underestimate a small person.  That's exactly how this book it. There is spiritual dynamite on the pages and so don't underestimate the transformational power in this little paperback (or hardback). It leveled me to the ground about 12 years ago.  It is still at the top of my list. As a pastor, I have recommended this book to many, many people.  It usually changes their lives.  The fruit tends to be enduring and deep. I think this book should be read by every Christian.  If you don't have a copy, buy an extra one so that you can have a loaner.

original doc: How wonderful to be able to write something for kids to do that is so appealing to read about as well. Makes scientific ideas easily acccessible.
most simular: This book is an eye-opener for those of us who like to think of themselves as rational people. It points out, with great accuracy and good stories, little glitches in the way that humans are wired that can be exploited. For someone who is looking for an introduction to psychology, this is the very best. You will not be able to put this book down. The book goes into an array of stories that outline how we respond in certain situations.  For example, why does no one help a person in need when there is a crowd around?  Why do we feel obligated to contribute to people who are nice to us, or who have given us a gift, even if the gift has a very low value compared to the contribution being asked.  Why does authority have such a strong effect on us, often leading to unquestioned crazy behavior?

original doc: I really like the way this book is set up. I feel like it is gonna be a good tool next year in nursing school
most simular: I got this book as a Christmas gift. I started writing in it around the middle of January, and have been doing so everyday since. I really appreciate the space (although I write more sometimes) and the size (as I take it with me when I travel). I've never been good at keeping a journal, but this has kept me excited and intrigued to see what the next day holds. I'm looking forward to doing this year after year, and I'll be giving these as gifts. I love them!
least simular: Este autor en general lo recomiendo ampliamente. Todos sus cuentos tienen moralejas e invitan mucho a la reflexión del mismo. Y este no se queda atras. Sus cuentos, además, son faciles de leer hasta para los pequeños empezando el proceso de lectoescritura. Muy recomendado.
